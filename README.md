## Applying local changes to your GitHub repository

If you make updates in this workspace and want to push them back to GitHub:

1. Ensure your changes are committed:
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Describe your changes"
   ```
2. Verify that the `origin` remote points to your GitHub repository. If it does not, set it:
   ```bash
   git remote set-url origin https://github.com/<your-username>/<your-repo>.git
   ```
3. Push the branch to GitHub:
   ```bash
   git push origin <branch-name>
   ```
4. Open a pull request (if needed) from GitHub's interface or merge the branch directly, depending on your workflow.

Replace `<your-username>`, `<your-repo>`, and `<branch-name>` with the appropriate values for your project.
